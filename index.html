                <p>
                    I love studying and learning something new, and I think I will be studying all my life. I enjoy discovering and exploring things that I never made before, I like challenges, accomplishing goals, and feeling the taste of victory. 
                    In my free time and when I am not studying, I love to stay home with my family and watch a good movie, spend time playing video games with my kids, and play soccer with them is super fun.
                    I like sports as well, my favorite sport to watch is Formula One, I have been a super fan since I was younger, I used to watch races with my grandfather, we were a fan of the 3-time world champion Ayrton Senna, every Sunday after church we used to run to home and watch the race, good times.
